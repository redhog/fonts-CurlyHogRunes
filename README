sub-culture. They strive to provide a full set of fonts for a document

_.-~^ TOOLS ^~-._
 '-~_________~-´
These fonts started out as pencil drawings, which got scanned. The
scans where cleaned up using GIMP, then turned into vector graphics
using autotrace, and the vector graphics cleaned up using Inkscape.
Lastly, they where imported into FontForge and split into individual
glyphs and further cleaned up. Some characters where constructed from
parts of other characters.

All these tools are Free Software and available on the UNIX platform.

_.-~^ License ^~-._
The fonts are dual licensed under the SIL font license and the GNU GPL
with the font exception.



===={ HACKING }====
_.-~^ Widths ^~-._
 '-~__________~-´
All glyphs in all versions have 0 left bearing and 50 right bearing.
The space character is 150 wide, plus the bearing.

Descent is 284.

Ascent is 598 for all glyphs except the braces and pipe, which have an
ascent of 740 (= 598 + 284/2).

The design height is thus 740+284 = 1024.
